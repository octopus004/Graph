This project implements a graph data structure as adjacency matrix with multiple functionalities including input/output, node and edge manipulation, graph representation, and analysis algorithms.

Key features include:
- Input from terminal or file
- Adding and removing nodes and edges
- Displaying the graph as an adjacency matrix
- Finding the largest strongly connected component using Kosaraju`s algorithm
- Calculating influence scores using a modified Dijkstra algorithm for probability-based paths
- Finding the most likely path between nodes with path reconstruction

# How to run
```
  g++ -o graph Source2.cpp
  ./graph

```
Will see a menu with options. Enter the number corresponding to the action you want to perform and press Enter.
For file input, provide the filename including its extension (make sure the file is in the same folder).
